# About Me

Hi there!  My name is Dennis, and I've been a software engineer working in the Silicon Valley for a number of years now.
I'm a very intellectually curious person, and I've listed a few personal projects that I've recently worked on here. I
hope you enjoy them!

## Browser Extension that Creates Visual Test Cases

This browser extension allows the user to visually author cross-browser UI tests for their web interfaces.  The visual
test cases are stored on a server and can be sent to a backend that can run the tests asynchronously. 

The other part of this project is a way to visually compare each test execution.  The web-based UI allows comparisons of
each test run against the recorded test, as well as other test runs as well.
